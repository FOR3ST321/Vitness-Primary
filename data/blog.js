            Daily movement is important. It’s easy to get to the end of your busy day and realize that you haven’t moved in hours, but as studies show, our sedentary lifestyle is harming our health. The good news? Daily movement can be integrated into your routine without rearranging your life. Here’s how:
            <br><br>
            <strong>1. Add a morning routine: five movements in five minutes.</strong> <br>
            With a quick morning movement routine, you can set a tone for the day that allows you to control your schedule, rather than the other way around. Take five minutes and spend one minute doing each stretch.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Roll your feet:</strong >While standing, roll each foot out on a tennis ball from heel to toe. Give extra attention to any areas that feel tender. This helps with foot flexibility, which aids balance and coordination.
            <br>
            <strong>Forward hang:</strong> Bend forward from the hips, holding opposite elbows, and let your head hang heavily. Nod your head yes and shake it no, gently.
            <br>
            <strong>Easy seated twist: </strong> Sitting on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you, cross your right leg over your left, keeping your left straight. Plant your right foot flat on the ground and use your left elbow on the outside of your right knee to twist. Turn from your core, and then look to the back of the room.
            <br>
            <strong>Chest opener</strong> While standing, interlock your fingers behind your back, palms facing in. Extend your arms out and up, behind you.
            <br>
            <strong>Back opener</strong> Still standing, interlock your fingers in front of you, palms facing in. Extend your arms forward, out and up, parallel to the floor. Then flip your grip so your palms face away from you. Push your arms away from your body and hollow your chest, look toward the floor and feel the stretch in your upper back.
            <br> <br>

            <strong>2. Swap your daily commute for exercise.</strong> <br>
            If you’re working from home these days, you’re not commuting to work. That’s time you can add back into your day for good use. Consider spending the time to go for a walk, stretch or create a warmup routine before you sit down for the day. If you don’t have time for a walk, just step outside and take a few deep breaths. The fresh air can help cleanse your lungs and release tension.
            <br> <br>

            <strong>3. Take phone calls standing up.</strong> <br>
            As you start your day, look for opportunities to move a bit. Phone calls are a good time to stand up for a few minutes while talking. And studies show that walking during a meeting is better for communication, as the increased blood flow to your brain helps you articulate ideas better.
            <br> <br>

            <strong>4. Stretch at your desk.</strong> <br>
            If you are sitting for long periods of time, remember to keep it loose. Relieve neck and shoulder pain with a quick daily movement routine. 
            <br><br>

            <strong>5. Let the music move your daily movement.</strong> <br>
            Move with the music. Having tunes in the background can inspire you to move without even noticing it. Try a work-from-home playlist, like this one, that will be easy to work to, while also adding some energy to your day.
            <br> <br>

            More movement every day will help your mental clarity, energy levels and productivity. Active reflection at the end of each day will help you subconsciously reward yourself for doing things that made you feel better. This should motivate you to do it again the next day because you’re building a habit.

            Missing your workout buddy? There are still ways to get active with your best friend. Here are some tips to work up a sweat with your BFF while social distancing. <br>
            <br>

            <h4>Get Outside</h4>
            Outdoor workouts are a great way to get fresh air and enjoy safe partner workouts with physical distancing (also called social distancing).
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for a space that is big enough to maintain distance, such as a field, park or backyard. A flat surface is ideal to avoid twisting an ankle.</li>
                <li>To be sure you are staying 6 feet apart, bring a yoga mat and set up your space about a mat’s length apart from each other (the standard yoga mat is 5 feet, 8 inches long). You can do your workout on your mat, and your friend can stay on theirs.</li>
                <li>BYOG→ bring your own gear. Jump ropes, resistance bands and medicine balls are all great portable gear options to up the intensity of your workout. Coordinate with each other ahead of time so you both come prepared.</li>
                <li>Hit the trails. Plan a hike with your friend and choose a pace that challenges you both.</li>
            </ul>
            If you’re looking for a great workout to do outside, check out this Quick Body Weight Mobility Workout you can do anywhere. Body weight workouts are great to do with a friend because you don’t need special equipment to do them and they’re portable.
            <br><br>

            <h4>Go Virtual</h4>
            If you can’t meet up in person for partner workouts with social distancing, get creative and competitive with each other online.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Send each other challenge workouts and share the experience. You can find a variety of workouts to try here.</li>
                <li>Get into EMOM and AMRAP workouts EMOM workouts are based on doing a movement Every Minute On the Minute; AMRAP workouts push you to do As Many Repetitions As Possible. You can keep each other motivated to do every move on the minute, or you can try to max each other out with repetitions, trying to increase the number of reps with each move. For example, if you do five pushups you can challenge your friends to do 10. They can challenge you back to do 15, and so on. The winner is crowned when one of you cannot complete the number of reps required.</li>
                <li>Do the same workout, at the same time. Visit Vitness Primary Anywhere to pick out a workout together. You can use video conferencing or the phone to talk with each other while you work out. The more banter, the better.</li>
                <li>Choose a fitness program and stick with it together. Whether it’s a week, a month or longer, go in on a long-term fitness program together and hold each other accountable during partner workouts with social distancing.</li>
            </ul>
            The best part of a workout buddy is the accountability and support. Keep each other motivated and on track with sweaty selfies and frequent check-ins, talking through challenges and goals.

            Whether you are traveling for work or going on vacation, exercising while you’re on the road might not be your top priority, but we’ve created the perfect travel workout for you that can be done without going to the gym or using any equipment.
            <br> <br>
            This full-body workout is great for your glutes, abs and legs. It doesn’t require equipment, can be done anywhere and takes less than 20 minutes.
            <br><br>

            <h4>Why it works</h4>
            This workout is designed to get multiple muscles working at once so you can train the whole body. Along with mixing a high-intensity level with isolated movements, it incorporates some core exercises to increase your heartrate and it keep it at a fat-burning zone. Because the five basic moves are repeated, you can adjust the length of the workout to fit your needs and perform just about anywhere.
            <br><br>
            <h4>The Core on the Go workout</h4>
            <strong>1. Glute bridge</strong>
            <br>
            Lying flat on a mat or the floor with your knees bent and feet flat, lift your hips into the air. Squeeze your glutes and keep a straight line through your knees, hips and shoulders.
            <br><br>
            <strong>2. Single leg glute bridge</strong>
            <br>
            From the glute bridge position, lift your right leg in the air, isolating the glute. (Your left foot should still be flat.) Keep your body in a straight line from your shoulders to your foot in the air. Return to the glute bridge position and repeat sequence with the other leg.
            <br><br>
            <strong>3. Bicycle crunches</strong>
            <br>
            Lying with your back flat and your hands behind your head, lift your chest slightly (but don’t strain your neck) and start to bring your left knee up. Twisting slightly, touch your right elbow to your left knee, and then extend your left leg and repeat the movement with the other elbow and leg. Continually alternate sides.
            <br><br>
            <strong>4. Russian twist</strong>
            <br>
            Sitting on the floor, lift your feet slightly off the ground and engage your core by leaning back about 45 degrees. Hold your hands together in front of you and rotate your upper body from side to side using smooth, controlled motions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>5. Squat pulse</strong>
            <br>
            Stand with your feet slightly wider than your shoulders. Get into squat position and then continually raise and lower your butt about 6 inches. It’s going to burn, but you want constant movement. Feel those quads and glutes working as you pulse!
            <br><br>

            "Want to deal with holiday stress and anxiety better? there's an app for that",
        category: "Daily Live",

            It’s the most wonderful time of the year, so the song goes. And truly, it can be. Shopping centres are playing happy songs, Christmas decorations can be found all over the city and you’ll soon hopefully have some time off work to see friends and family.
            <br>
            While all of these are great, the holiday period is also known to cause stress and anxieties, causing a deterioration in the mental health of many people. Here are some suggestions on how to manage those issues, and what apps might be useful to help you cope.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Lock Things In</strong> <br>
            A big part of holiday stress is that there is often so much to do and so little time! One way to navigate this would be to try to plan things ahead – you know that you only have a few weeks left before the new year, so prioritise what you want to get in. This could be a short trip away, visiting family or just catching up on TV shows you’ve been meaning to watch. You could easily use a calendar to do the planning – so if the day is full, it’s full – or use a productivity app like Trello which lets you throw several ideas, priority lists and even set reminders in one interface as a general guide if you prefer something less rigid.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Give Yourself A Break</strong> <br>
            As you make your plans and fit people in, make sure that you also find time for yourself. This is especially so when you know things are going to get hectic. One way to do this is actually to pen some “me time” into your schedules. This could be just a day off between socialising – so block that day out so you don’t make any plans for that – or actually booking yourself in for a day of pampering at the spa. There are other little things you can do as well – download the Headspace app which can help with mindfulness, do a little bit daily and that way, you have at least a few minutes to yourself each day just for you.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Check In With Yourself</strong> <br>
            Being busy and having lots of plans – a situation you might find yourself in while on holiday – doesn’t always bode well for your mental health. In fact, one source of stress and anxiety is just being so constantly overwhelmed that you don’t have time to process anything, let alone understand how you’re feeling. Realising that you need to pause and take a step back can be helpful. A mood tracker app can be helpful for this, so why not try Moodkit which incorporates several features based on psychotherapy methods to help you manage your mood and general well-being.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Work Out</strong> <br>
            It’s a long-established fact that exercise can help improve your mood, alleviate stress and manage some mental health issues so don’t forget to keep your workouts going. During the holidays, things can get so busy that your fitness doesn’t always get prioritised. What’s more, there can also be a lot of guilt associated with missing your workouts – especially when you’re being merry and eating all the delicious holiday fare – that can contribute more to your stress and anxieties. If you’re too busy (or travelling) and can’t get to a gym, just go for a run or a walk when you can, or use an app like 7-Minute Workout to squeeze in a quick session. You’ll definitely feel better.
            <br>
            We all know how difficult the holiday period can be. Hopefully, with these suggestions and apps, this year you’ll be all ready to take them on. Happy holidays!

            In the summer of 2021, bodybuilder and former Merchant Marine Joe Gold founded Vitness Primary in a cinder-block building in Venice Beach, California, with equipment he built himself.
            <br> <br>
            1 years later, what began as a small gym at the beach has grown into a global phenomenon. 
            Thanks to word of mouth, Pumping Iron, and an explosion in fitness culture, Vitness Primary has grown into what it is 
            today: the world’s most iconic fitness brand. Five and a half decades since the Mecca first opened, 
            Vitness Primary now has nearly 700 gyms in 29 countries around the globe.
            <br> <br>
